### PUSH vs PULL Observer
1. Push implementation, you get the object that has the data. The pull is when you get a link to the object, then you query to get the infromation. The practical difference becomes is how much data we are passing around. The pull is for low resource networks.

### Creating chains vs existing chains for CoR pattern
1. Threaded Tree: A linked list that goes through all the nodes of the tree. To see all the nodes, we go to linked list. To visit children, we use the tree stucture.
2. The difference in that in case of the tree, the pre existing chain already exists while the encryption one we had to create the chain

### Command design pattern vs Executing method call
1. Anonymity in the command pattern
2. Control over the execution timing (order, timing) in the command pattern

### Template method implemented with: Inheritance vs. Composition
1. Main purpose of both is Code Sharing. Composition is to not get into multiple inheritance. No polymorphism in composition implementation.


### Benefits of design patterns in software engineering
1. Shared language for teams of developers - communication at higher level
2. Designing and maintaing software at a higher level
3. Better code structure - looser coupling
